Day-6

VA => VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT.
VA Assessment Process

*Asset discovery
*Vulnerability scanning
*Vulnerability assessment
*Vulnerability remediation.

NVD => National Vulnerability Database
CVSS =>Common Vulnerability scoring system

Scanners
*automated vulnerability scanning
*penetration testing

API => Transferring data from front end to back end (application programming interface)

Policy=>Governess
Procedure=> Step by step process of a policy
Standard=>there have the define rules
Regulations=>rules given by the government

Penetration Testing:
1.Information Gathering=>How many hosts are there and How many routers are there and we can identify what are the protocols are used
2.Scanning=> In which ports what vesrions are running
3.Gaining access:Gain basics access.Find the vulnerabilty and exploit it
4.Maintaining access=>Also called persistance
5.Clearing tracks=>To remove all digital footprints.

Penetration testing:
Internal=> This testing is performed within the organisation across the LAN(there have some limitation)
External=>The testing is done on the web application =>outside the organisation.(there have no limitation)

why do we need cybersecurity->to protect yourself

 Types of Foot Printing
->Active-directly interacting
->Passive-trying to collect the information

Phising is also called social engineering attack
Malware->malicious software
rootkits-> a type of malware designed to give hackers access to and control over a target device
trojan->it is one type of software,but it is hide inside other software.In one suitation it will come outside
Ransomware->
dos->one person focus on one attack
Ddos->Distributed Denial of Services Attack->many people focus on one attack

Encrytion->step by step process
Threat Actors->also called as bad actors,individual or groups that intentional cause harm to digital devices or system

Types of threat actors
->Cybercriminals
->Nation state actors
->Hacktivists
->Thrill seekers
->Insider threats
->Cyberterrorists

NIST cybersecurity Framework***
->Identify
->Protect
->Detect
->Respond
->Recover

If fireball know the connection,knowledge of packet->state ful
If firewall have no knowledge in packet->state less

HIDS->Host Based Intrusion Detection System
NIDS->Network Based Intrusion Detection System
MDM->Management Device Management
Endpoint Protection->Antivirus
CASB->Cloud Access Security Broker

Compliance->confirming to a rule such as specification,policy,standard or law

WSA=> SECURE WEB APPLIANCE.
FRAMEWORK => COLLECTION OF TOOLS OR  SOFTWARE
CLOUD SERVICE MODEL:
    SaaS-Software as a service
    PaaS-Platform as a service
    IaaS-Infrastructure as a service
PLATFORM =>IT PROVIDES EVERYTHING LIKE IDE 
HOW CLOUD WORKS
   => Data storage
   =>Access anywhere
   =>Virtualisation
   =>Scalability
   =>Cost-effective

RISK MANAGEMENT
->Risk Acceptance-A cyber security risk assessment is the process of identifying, analysing and evaluating risk. 
It helps to ensure that the cyber security controls you choose are appropriate to the risks your organisation faces.
->Risk Avoidance-without using limitation,mitigation we should prevent before
->Risk Mitigation-a strategy to prepare for and lessen the effects of threats faced by a business.
->Risk Transfer-transfering risk for one system to other system

Threat Protection->In cloud security having some data we want protect it with encryption
Shared Responsibility->in this method there have cloud services and user shareing their resources.
Business Continuity->data cannot be backed up in same system.It stored in the cloud and secured
on -primises->with ite campus

Cloud Security Models
->public cloud security - public access
->private cloud security -  private access
->Hydrid cloud security- combination of public and private 
->Community cloud security - multiple organisation 

Regulatory Compliance in Cloud security

->GDPR-General Data Protection Regulation
->HIPAA-Health Portability and Accountability
->PCIDSS-Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard
->ISO 27001-International Standard Outlining

ISMS-Information Security Management System

CISCO WSA Features

->Data loss Prevention
->Native FTP Protection

Types WAF(web application firewall)
->Network Based
->Host Based
->Cloud Based

how do u detect the SQL injection->single or double quotes*****

Spear phishing->specific attack
Whaling->top people attack

EDR-Endpoint Detection and Response
SOP-Standard Operating Procedure(do the work within the time limit)
PIP- Performance Improvement Plan
SLA-Service-Level Agreement

MITRE ATT&CK- MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge(MITRE is one type corporation)
(The MITRE ATT&CK framework is like a playbook for cybersecurity teams. 
It lists out all the tricks and tactics that hackers might use to attack a computer network.
By studying this playbook, cybersecurity professionals can better defend against these attacks and keep their systems safe)
